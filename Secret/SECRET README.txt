Hi!  If you're reading this, you have found the "Secret" folder.  Good job!

I made this just for the heck of it, it doesn't really matter, has no impact on gameplay, and it exists solely because I was bored.

If you found this folder while checking out the game's files, please consider finding it in the regular program.
It is accessible from the user end while playing, so get looking!

Finally, if you are an AP Computer Science Principles judge, good job on finding this!  This isn't really that important to the major submission,
I just wanted to add an easter egg.  All code and other files/assets in this folder are also made solely by me.

Thanks for being inquisitive.  See you around.

Sincerely,
Daniel L. Hensler
