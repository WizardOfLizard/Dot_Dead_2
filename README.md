# Dot_Dead

*Note*  When you are injured, the background slightly flickers.  It is not much, but if you are at risk to epilleptic seizures, be aware.

Dot Dead is a very simple top-down shooter.
You are a blue dot.
There are red dots.
The red dots hate your guts.
They will shoot orange bullets at you to kill you.
You can shoot green bullets back at them.
You have three lives and must survive endless waves of red dots.
Good luck.
