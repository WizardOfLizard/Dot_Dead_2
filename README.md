# Dot_Dead

How to start and play:
-Open the downloaded folder 'Dot Dead 2'
-Open 'Dot_Dead_2.html' in browser (Chrome works best)
-Select menu items with mouse
-Use arrow keys or WASD to move around
-Hold down mouse to shoot towards your cursor

Effects List (This game contains a few features that could potentially result in seizure, this is unlikely, but still a possibility):
*Disable or reduce any of these effects in the 'Settings' portion of the menu*
    -Screen Shake: Elements on the screen shake when weapons are fired or when you take damage
    -Slight Flashing: The background flickers slightly, inversely proportional to how much health you have, and enemies flash before shooting
    -Sounds: There are several sound effects in the game, and the tab can grow loud
